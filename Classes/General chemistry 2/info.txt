Dear Students

 

First of all, thank you very much for joining this course. As I discussed in the first class (Wednesday), the timing of ‘general chemistry’ class is overlapped with my another class. I contacted the department office regarding this matter. They said to me, no slot is vacant in the daytime. So, I decided to choose Friday evening slot (from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.). However, I am planning to upload the ‘video lecture’ anytime on Friday. So, no need to worry about class time, just you need to listen to the video lecture. In the meantime, we will continue the zoom class every Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. In this regard, I have to submit a document “Changing the class timing” to the department office. For this, I need the consent of all students with signatures. Here I am attaching the confirmation letter form, please write your name, student no. and signature. And then send it (scan or photo file) to me by tomorrow.  

Thank you in advance.

 

With Regards
